# KNN algorithm

Project: https://apiquet.com/2018/12/01/k-nearest-neighbour-knn/

KNN is a learning algorithm which can be used for classification. 
The output is classified by a majority vote of its neighbours.

I used it to classified data points.


You can either run ''test_knn_2D.m'' script or go to the ''Results'' folder to see the results.
